## deepSI\_lite

deepSI\_lite a lightweight and flexible implementation of the SUBNET structure for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems (i.e. system identification). 

## todo list

* Compile?
* Create Example notebook
* CT with sample_time = None?
* multi variate ny=int and norm  
* Validate implementation with re-running of old results
* Exporting to MATLAB
* General documentation 
* warn upon accidental mixing of sample times
* changing of sample times with encoder (re-sample)
* DT SUBNET should check if the sample time is unchanged!
